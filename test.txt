Plan

1) give each list a certain amount of '\n' so the list always has the same amount of items in a list
2) if a list has more than the certain amount of rows then increase rows by one for all lists
3) make character count for each item a certain number by appending spaces
4) if a task has more characters, add spaces to all the rest of the lists 


while < 20:
something += 1
